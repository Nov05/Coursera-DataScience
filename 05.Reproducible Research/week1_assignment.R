# We are conducting research on the ways that people use data
# analysis and data science tools. Your participation in this 
# non-graded and completely optional peer assessment will be 
# part of that research. We will not collect any personally 
# identifiable information about you for the purposes of this 
# research and only aggregated totals of responses to questions 
# will be reported. The potential risks to you are small. 
# The potential benefits to the community of data scientists, 
# developers, and professors are very high â€“ we will be able 
# to figure out which methods work and which methods do not. 
# These two plotting exercises are 100% optional and will 
# not have any influence whatsoever on your grade in the class. 
# Thanks for considering helping us learn about data science!

# Instructions:
#     
#     To practice the plotting techniques you have learned 
#     so far, you will be making a graphic that explores 
#     relationships between variables. This practice is useful 
#     since we will later cover creating reproducible graphics 
#     in this class. You will be looking at a subset of a 
#     United States medical expenditures dataset with information 
#     on costs for different medical conditions and in different 
#     areas of the country.
# 
# You should do the following:
#     
#     1. Make a plot that answers the question: what is the 
#     relationship between mean covered charges 
#     (Average.Covered.Charges) and mean total payments 
#     (Average.Total.Payments) in New York?
#     
#     2. Make a plot (possibly multi-panel) that answers the 
#     question: how does the relationship between mean covered 
#     charges (Average.Covered.Charges) and mean total payments 
#     (Average.Total.Payments) vary by medical condition 
#     (DRG.Definition) and the state in which care was received 
#     (Provider.State)?
#     
# Use only the base R graphics system (not ggplot2 or lattice) 
# to make your figure.
# 
# Please submit 
# (1) R code that creates your plots, 
# (2) a single pdf for plot 1 and 
# (3) a single pdf for plot 2. 
# You will be graded on whether you answered the questions 
# and a number of features describing the clarity of the plots 
# including axis labels, figure legends, figure captions, and 
# plots. For guidelines on how to create production quality 
# plots see Chapter 10 of the Elements of Data Analytic Style 
# (https://www.dropbox.com/s/rybd14gq60jzira/edas_chapter10.pdf?dl=0)
# 
# To make the plots use the data in the attached .csv file. 
# These data are a processed version of the data from the site: 
# https://data.cms.gov/Medicare/Inpatient-Prospective-Payment-System-IPPS-Provider/97k6-zzx3
# 
# payments.csv
# https://d18ky98rnyall9.cloudfront.net/_e143dff6e844c7af8da2a4e71d7c054d_payments.csv?Expires=1482278400&Signature=JN2VCajQYJpBW1R4XDol7HtwUevC1q-EO3II7X-C928JjBbYg4N2pXQuTvzj~FdYUpdsmc2Su7dScNf~pv9Lac7N5CMP9fQRwbs2Vu4Cv4V3SNUmOiPWmGIjBNnHSCLDCVUMDX~-VpH2yUVYkL4btxjQPqNIsYyy~9A8beiq1lQ_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A
